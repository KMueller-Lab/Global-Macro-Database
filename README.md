This repository complements our paper, **MÃ¼ller, Xu, Lehbib, and Chen (2025)**, which introduces a panel dataset of **46 macroeconomic variables across 243 countries** from historical records beginning in the year **1086** until **2024**, including projections through the year **2030**.




## Features

- **Unparalleled Coverage**: Combines data from **32 contemporary sources** (e.g., IMF, World Bank, OECD) and **86 historical datasets**, totaling **118 sources**.
- **Extensive Variables**: Covers national accounts, consumption, investment, trade, prices, government finances, interest rates, employment, and financial crises.
- **Transparent Source Prioritization**: Prioritizes country-specific sources over international aggregators to ensure both historical depth and accuracy.
- **Harmonized Data**: All data is cleaned, spliced, and chainlinked for consistent cross-country comparison.
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Variable definitions follow SNA 2008 standards and are documented in the technical appendix.
- **Frequent Updates**: Quarterly releases with version control and changelogs.
- **Open Access & Tools**: Access data via web, Python, R, or Stata packages. All processing code is open source.
