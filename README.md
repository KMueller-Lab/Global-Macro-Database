This repository complements our paper, **MÃ¼ller, Xu, Lehbib, and Chen (2025)**, which introduces a panel dataset of **46 macroeconomic variables across 243 countries** from historical records beginning in the year **1086** until **2024**, including projections through the year **2030**.




## Features

- **Unparalleled Coverage**: Combines data from **32 contemporary sources** (e.g., IMF, World Bank, OECD) and **86 historical datasets**, totaling **118 sources**.
- **Extensive Variables**: Covers national accounts, consumption, investment, trade, prices, government finances, interest rates, employment, and financial crises.
- **Transparent Source Prioritization**: Prioritizes country-specific sources over international aggregators to ensure both historical depth and accuracy.
- **Harmonized Data**: All data is cleaned, spliced, and chainlinked for consistent cross-country comparison.
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Variable definitions follow SNA 2008 standards and are documented in the technical appendix.
- **Frequent Updates**: Quarterly releases with version control and changelogs.
- **Open Access & Tools**: Access data via web, Python, R, or Stata packages. All processing code is open source.

## Release Note (2025\_06)

### Overview

Released June 30, 2025. This update brings improved inflation series, methodological refinements in government finance construction, six new historical sources, and enhanced priority logic across core variables.

### Key Changes

#### Inflation Data Patch

- Fixed issues caused by breaks in CPI series.
- Revised source priority list to incorporate new sources.

#### New Sources and Coverage

- Integrated six new datasets: `RR_infl`, `Clio`, `UN_trade`, `BEL_1`, `CAN_2`, and `KOR_2`.
- Revised source hierarchy for `nGDP`, `cons`, `inv`, `finv`, `imports`, and `exports`.

#### Government Finance Methodology

- Fiscal series (`govdebt`, `govdef`, `govexp`, `govrev`, `govtax`) are now derived from GDP ratios.
- Applied chainlinking to back out consistent level series.

#### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Enhanced the robustness of the cleaning pipeline.
- Addressed inconsistencies across a few long-run sources.

## Acknowledgments

The development of the Global Macro Database would not have been possible without the generous funding provided by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) through the PYP grants (WBS A-0003319-01-00 and A-0003319-02-00), a Tier 1 grant (A-8001749- 00-00), and the NUS Risk Management Institute (A-8002360-00-00). This financial support laid the foundation for the successful completion of this extensive project.
